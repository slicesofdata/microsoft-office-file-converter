# microsoft-office-file-converter

A Windows based program written in AutoHotkey for bulk conversion of 2003 Microsoft Office files (e.g., doc, docx, etc.) to current "x" versions; and vice versa
- executable program provided; does not require install
- useful for bulk converting: doc -> docx; ppt -> pptx; xls -> xlsx; doc/docx/ppt/pptx -> pdf etc.
- requires MS Office installation to operate; uses COM
- checks for installed office programs and acrobat programs for performing conversion and lists the available conversions
- will not overwrite existing files (but also does not create a new enumerated file version, something to add)
